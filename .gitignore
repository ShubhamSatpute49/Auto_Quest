Got it 👍 You want to design a **Car Dealership Website in MERN** with a structured hierarchy of **Owner → Brand CEO → Showroom Manager → Employees**. Let me give you some **suggestions (not code)** on how to approach this:

---

### 1. **Define User Roles & Hierarchy**

* **Owner (Super Admin)**

  * Can add/remove brands
  * Can assign CEO to a brand
  * Can view overall reports (sales, employees, revenue across brands)

* **Brand CEO**

  * Manages all showrooms under their brand
  * Can add/remove showrooms and assign managers
  * Gets brand-level analytics (total sales, inventory, performance of all showrooms under that brand)

* **Showroom Manager**

  * Heads a single showroom
  * Manages employees (salesperson, inventory handler)
  * Monitors showroom-specific sales and inventory

* **Employees (at showroom level)**

  * **Salesperson** → Handle customer leads, car sales, invoices
  * **Inventory Handler** → Manage stock of cars, incoming/outgoing vehicles

---

### 2. **Core Entities (Collections in MongoDB)**

* **User** (with role: owner, CEO, manager, employee)
* **Brand** (name, logo, CEO assigned)
* **Showroom** (location, brand ID, manager ID)
* **Car** (brand, model, price, stock count, showroom ID)
* **Employee** (linked to showroom, role type: sales/inventory)
* **Customer** (details of buyers, their purchases, leads)
* **Sales Record** (car, showroom, salesperson, customer, date, amount)
* **Inventory Record** (car stock updates, movements)

---

### 3. **Access Control & Permissions**

Use **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:

* Owner → Full control
* CEO → CRUD on brands & showrooms under them
* Manager → CRUD on employees & cars in their showroom
* Employees → Limited (Salesperson can create sales, Inventory handler can update stock)

---

### 4. **Features to Include**

* **Authentication & Authorization** (JWT + role-based access)

* **Dashboard for Each Role**

  * Owner → All brands overview
  * CEO → Showrooms of their brand
  * Manager → Employees & showroom-level reports
  * Employees → Simple UI for their tasks

* **Car Listings** (search, filter by brand, model, price)

* **Inventory Management** (real-time stock updates per showroom)

* **Sales Management** (record sales, generate invoice)

* **Customer Management** (track leads, follow-ups, sales history)

* **Reports & Analytics** (sales trends, brand performance, showroom performance)

---

### 5. **Tech Suggestions**

* **Frontend (React)**: React Router (for role-based navigation), Redux/Context (for state management), Tailwind/Bootstrap (UI)
* **Backend (Node + Express)**: REST APIs with JWT-based role authentication
* **Database (MongoDB)**: Collections as mentioned above with proper references (e.g., showroom → brand → CEO)
* **Deployment**:

  * Backend → Node.js on server (e.g., Render, AWS, Railway)
  * Frontend → Netlify/Vercel
  * Database → MongoDB Atlas

---

### 6. **Future Enhancements**

* Online **car booking system** (customers reserve cars)
* **Finance/EMI options** integration
* **Service/maintenance tracking** after sales
* **AI-powered analytics** (most sold models, customer trends)

---

👉 Suggestion: Start **small** (Owner → Brand → Showroom → Employees + Car Inventory & Sales). Once the base works, expand into customer booking, payments, etc.

Do you want me to also suggest a **basic database relationship (ERD)** structure for this project? That will give you a clear map before coding.
